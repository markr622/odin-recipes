<h2>Description</h2>
<p>You call it Chili, we call it Chilli Con Carne. 
    Whatever you know this as, the alluring smell of a pot of Chilli bubbles away 
    on the stove is a universal language!! 
    Whip it this up as a quick meal, though if you have time to slow cook you’ll 
    be rewarded with ultra tender beef and an extra luscious sauce. Serve over rice, or corn chips for dunking. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves , minced</li>
    <li>1 onion , diced (brown, white, yellow)</li>
    <li>1 red capsicum (bell pepper), diced</li>
    <li>1 lb / 500g beef mince / ground beef</li>
    <li>3 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato</li>
    <li>14 oz / 420g can red kidney beans , drained (or other beans)</li>
    <li>2 beef bouillon cubes , crumbled (Note 1)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp sugar (any type)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 1 minute, then add capsicum and cook for 2 minutes until onion is translucent.</li>
    <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as you go, until mostly browned.</li>
    <li>Add Chili Spice Mix. Cook until beef is browned all over. (This step helps release extra flavour from the spices)</li>
    <li>Add remaining ingredients, with 1/2 cup of water for Quick Cook or 1 1/2 cups for Slow Cook. Bring to simmer, then adjust heat per step below:</li>
    <li>Quick Cook – 20 to 40 minutes, uncovered, on medium low heat so it’s bubbling gently; OR</li>
    <li>Slow Cook – 1.5 hours to 2 hours, covered, on low heat so it’s bubbling very gently. (Note 3 Slow Cooker)</li>
