        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 medium carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>3 parsnips, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>3 celery ribs, sliced</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 leek, halved lengthwise, sliced, and rinsed</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper/li>
        <li>2 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>5 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup roughly chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Saute the veggies. Heat the oil in a large pot on medium heat. Add the carrots, parsnips, celery, leek, and onion to the pot and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the garlic, salt, and pepper, and stir for another minute.</li>
        <li>Poach the chicken. Add the thyme, tarragon, bay leaf, chicken, and broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Simmer the soup for 15 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Shred the chicken. With tongs, remove the chicken to a cutting board and then gently shred the chicken with two forks. Place the shredded chicken back into the pot and simmer for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve. Remove the sprigs of thyme, tarragon and the bay leaf. Stir in the parsley, and garnish with additional fresh parsley and black pepper before serving.</li>
    </ol>
